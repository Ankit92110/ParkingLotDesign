# 🚗 Parking Lot System (LLD) – Java

A scalable, object-oriented **Parking Lot System** built in Java, demonstrating **Low-Level Design (LLD)** principles. Designed with extensibility, clean architecture, and real-world constraints such as multi-floor parking, dynamic vehicle types, and multiple payment methods.

---

## 📌 Features

* ✅ Supports **multi-floor** and **multi-slot** parking
* 🚗 Handles **3+ vehicle types** (e.g., Car, Bike, Truck)
* 💳 Offers **multiple payment methods** – Credit Card, UPI, and Cash
* 🧠 Implements **entry/exit gates**, slot tracking, and ticket generation
* ⚙️ Built using core **OOP**, **SOLID principles**, and design patterns
* 🔌 Designed for extensibility – future integration of EV slots, dashboards, etc.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack & Concepts

* **Language**: Java
* **Design Patterns**: Strategy, Factory, Singleton
* **Architecture**: Clean Code, Layered Design, Interface-Driven Development
* **Data Structures**: Map, List (In-memory storage)

---


## 🧪 Sample Scenario (Demo)

1. System initializes with 3 floors and 1000+ total slots.
2. User enters with a **Bike**, system assigns nearest available slot.
3. On exit, user selects **UPI** for payment and receives a receipt.
4. Admin dashboard (future scope) gets updated with analytics.

---

## 🔧 Design Principles Applied

* ✅ **Open/Closed Principle** – Add new vehicle or payment types without changing existing code
* ✅ **Single Responsibility Principle** – Separation of concerns across services and models
* ✅ **Strategy Pattern** – For dynamic payment method selection
* ✅ **Factory Pattern** – For object creation abstraction
* ✅ **Singleton Pattern** – For central system access/config

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* EV Charging Slot Support ⚡
* Web/Admin Dashboard UI 🌐
* Persistent Storage using SQL/NoSQL 🗃️
* REST API Integration using Spring Boot 🌱
